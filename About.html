<h1>About Me</h1>

  Darrian is a talented and passionate artist, designer, and writer who enjoys
  all aspects of the creative process. She has published over 60 cover designs
  that have been widely enjoyed by customers in the United States, United
  Kingdom, and Canada, which led her to launch her second e-commerce business:

  She has had the pleasure of designing posters and spearheading event branding
  for both the Strome and Forestburg Curling Clubs. As well as logo design for
  Lake Country Group, and @apartmentdrummer, the latter of which allowed her to
  employ her skills in web design as well.

  Darrian is also an award winning photographer with photos featured by Tourism
  Calgary, and has done employee headshots for both Long and McQuade Musical
  Instruments and Chinook School of Music.
